**Development, Staging, and Production Environment Setup Plan**

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for T1.3 "Environment Configuration" of the Rangkai Edu project. The task involves setting up development, staging, and production environments, creating Docker images for both frontend and backend components, configuring Docker Compose for local development, establishing proper Git branching strategies, and implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. The plan is structured into five distinct subtasks with clear ownership, timelines, and deliverables.

- Implement branch protection rules
- Document branching conventions
- Set up repository structure for collaboration

#### Detailed Tasks
1. Create required branches (main, develop, staging)
2. Implement branch protection rules for main and staging
3. Document Git branching strategy and workflows
4. Set up proper merge strategies and code review processes

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Git repository has proper branch structure (main, develop, staging) with protection rules
- Branching strategy documented and communicated to team
- Proper merge strategies implemented

### T1.3.5: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
**Duration**: 4 Days | **Ownership**: DevOps Mode

#### Objectives
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Configure automated testing and building
- Set up deployment workflows for different environments
- Implement proper security practices

#### Detailed Tasks
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD
2. Implement automated testing for both frontend and backend
3. Configure Docker image building and pushing to registry
4. Set up deployment workflows for staging environment
5. Implement security scanning and quality checks
6. Test workflow triggers and execution

#### Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Actions workflow file exists and successfully triggers on push to develop branch
- Automated testing and building configured for both components
- Deployment workflows implemented for staging environment
- Security and quality checks integrated into pipeline

## Dependencies Between Phases

- **Phase 2 (T1.3.2)** depends on **Phase 1 (T1.3.1)** - Both Docker images need to be created before configuring Docker Compose
- **Phase 3 (T1.3.3)** depends on **Phases 1 and 2** - Docker Compose configuration requires both backend and frontend Docker images
- **Phase 5 (T1.3.5)** depends on **Phase 4 (T1.3.4)** - CI/CD pipeline implementation requires proper Git branching structure
