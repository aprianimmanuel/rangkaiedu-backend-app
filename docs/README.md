## Overview

This documentation was created as part of Phase 3 of the T1.1 "Inisialisasi Codebase" task for the Rangkai Edu project. The focus was on:

- Defining API contracts between frontend and backend
- Setting up testing frameworks for both components
- Configuring code quality tools
- Validating integration between components

## Purpose

These documents serve as a guide for implementing the actual code changes and configurations needed for the integration and validation phase. They provide detailed instructions and best practices for:

- API development and documentation
- Testing framework setup and usage
- Code quality enforcement
- Integration testing procedures

## Next Steps

The implementation team should use these documents as a reference when setting up the actual tools and writing the necessary code for the Rangkai Edu application.
